# neuron-to-gpt
This repo tracks my adventures in understanding neural networks, guided by the incredible work of Andrej Karpathy (https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). Starting with the building blocks of individual neurons, I'm embarking on a quest to explore amazing things like text generators (GPT!). It's my playground where I can experiment, learn, and build some neat things with these fascinating algorithms!
